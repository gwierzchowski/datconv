Upgrade from Pandata version 0.1 to Datconv 0.2.x:
--------------------------------------------------

### Changes in files' layout
Pandata version 0.1 did not had its own installer. Everything was placed
in one folder. Now Datconv (renamed from Pandata) modules included in
package are being installed in special Python subfolder intended for
3-rd party modules. So all old Pandata core modules may be deleted from
current localisation. Recomended Datconv layout is now to keep user own
modules in subfolders of one folder, and run datconv script from that
folder or add user's "projects' folder" to PYTHONPATH environment
variable. Datconv core modules should be kept in Python sub-folders 
where installer placed them.

### Modules and classes name changes
Names of standard Reader and Writer modules has changed: `pdxml` -> `dcxml`,
`pdcsv` -> `dccsv`, `pdxpaths` -> `dcxpaths`. Appropriate changes should be done in user's 
YAML configuration files.

Fixed names of Reader, Filter and Writer classes has changed: `PDReader` -> `DCReader`,
`PDFilter` -> `DCFilter`, `PDWriter` -> `DCWriter`. Appropriate changes should be done 
in user's filters' definition files.

All version 0.1 modules were moved to common datconv meta
package as subpackages. So in user's YAML configuration files and in import
statements in filters `datconv.` specification should be added.

Example 1 (YAML file):  
`Module: writers.pdcsv`  
should be changed to:  
`Module: datconv.writers.dccsv`

Example 2 (filter definition):  
`from filters import WRITE`  
should be changed to:  
`from datconv.filters import WRITE`

### Change in main program invocation
Datconv main script is now included into system PATH. On Linux .py
file extension was removed, so it can be called like (without ./ prefix):
`datconv [options]`. On Windows script was renamed, so it can be called
like (without python explicit invocation): `datconv-run.py [options]`.

Note: windows Python installer should create file-type entries that
allow user to directly call python script (without python explicit
invocation). To check that, run following connads from command box:  
`C:\>assoc .py`  
sould give:  
`.py=Python.File`

and:  
`C:\>ftype Python.File`  
sould give:  
`Python.File="c:\python26\python.exe" "%1" %*`  

Important is `%\*` at end - what allows to pass additional arguments to
program.
