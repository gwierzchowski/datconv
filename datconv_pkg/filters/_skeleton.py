        :param record: is instance of root XML model of record returned by Reader (class of lxml.etree.ElementTree).
        
        This method may check or manipulate contents of record.
        
        | There are several ways to access already known data from current record, e.g.:
        | **record.tag** - the name of root tag (i.e. record name).
        | **record.find(xpath)** - returns first found (or None) record's sub-tag using relative, simplified xpath.
        |   e.g. record.find('.//TIME') - searches record tree and returns first found <TIME .../> tag.
        | **record.findtext(xpath)** - as above but returns .text attribute (see below) of found tag (or raise Exception if tag is not found)..
        | **record.xpath(xpath)** - evaluate full absolute xpath expression on record (i.e. return list of matched tags, or string, number etc. - depands on xpath).
        |   e.g. record.xpath('/Gampdf_winNbrs/winSet') - returns list of all winSet subtags of root Gampdf_winNbrs tag.
        
        | On record and also on tags returned by above methods the data associated with tag may be obtained using:
        | **tag.tag** - tag name (i.e. field name)
        | **tag.text** - text that is contained between opening and closing tag (usually data value)
        | **tag.keys()** - iterable containing tag attbibute names
        | **tag['attrib']** - the value of tag attribute named 'attrib'; raise Exception if tag does not contain 'attrib' atribute.
        | **tag.get('attrib')** - as above but returns None if no such attribute.
        | **record.insert(0, newtag)** - inserts new tag at begining of record
        | **etree.SubElement(record, 'NEWTAG')** - inserts new tag at and of record
        | See ``lxml`` package for more documentation.
        
        | This method should return combination of following bits:
        | WRITE  - to cause program to pass record to Writer for writting to output
        | REPEAT - to cause program to call filterRecord with the same record (instead or reading next record from input). This is used to produce / create new records. This option should be used with caution to avoid infinite loop (i.e. Filter should mainain its own replication counter and stop returning REPEAT at some point). 
        | BREAK  - to cause program to break process on this record (i.e. Reader will not read next record). In case when REPEAT | BREAK is returned, the REPEAT bit takes precedence.
        | or return SKIP (0) - what will cause that record will be skiped (will not be passed to Writer).
